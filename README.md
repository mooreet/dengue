## Disclaimers
* [Licence](https://github.com/mooreet/dengue/LICENSE.txt) is included here as a matter of general practice, but
 license is not intended to circumvent or have precedence over those used by anyone else I borrowed 
code from, notable I recommend looking at the benchmark by [ShaulAb](https://shaulab.github.io/DrivenData/DengAI/Benchmark.html) for R.

Or for python a script is provided in this [link](http://blog.drivendata.org/2016/12/23/dengue-benchmark/).  Check the Driven Data discussion boards for other starter scripts.
